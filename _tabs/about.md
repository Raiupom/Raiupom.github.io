My name is Hong Zha, 查 虹 in Chinese. So **虹** (Hong) is my first name, meaning 'Rainbow'. When I need decide my username (e.g., sign up an account), 'Rainbow' should be my first choice, but often it has already been taken by another user. To that end, I pinched the word `Raiupom` by flipping up and down the last four characters. It also holds a prophecy, ''**r**eal **AI** is **upon** us.''

The pronunciation of **虹** is the same as **２時** in Japanese. That is the reason why titled this site `两点钟的blog`.
